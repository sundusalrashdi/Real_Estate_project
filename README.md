Real Estate Data Integration, Cleaning, and Modeling
Objectives
This project involves gathering real estate data, cleaning and preparing it, building a model to predict property prices, and optionally creating APIs for cleaning data and making predictions.

APIs Used
Data was collected from a sample API or an Excel file. Each entry contains details like address, city, province, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, year built, and the latest sale price.

Data Collection and Cleaning Steps
Loaded data from the given source.

Checked the data for problems such as wrong data types or missing values.

Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, fixing formats, handling missing information, and making location and property-type data consistent.

Data Cleaning API (if created)
If implemented, this API accepts new property data, cleans it, and returns the cleaned version.

Modeling Approach and Results
A machine learning model was trained using features like location, size, rooms, and year built to predict prices. The model was tested and showed good accuracy.

Prediction API (if created)
If implemented, this API takes property details and returns a predicted price based on the model.

Files Included
A Jupyter Notebook with data loading, cleaning, and modeling steps.

Optional API scripts for cleaning and prediction.

Sample dataset (if provided).

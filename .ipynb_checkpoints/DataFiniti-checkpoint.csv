Located in Barr Al Jissah, 5 min from 5 stars hotels and all their amenities. Close to a traditional fishing village of Qantab, 10 minutes from the old Muttrah Souq. You will be able to enjoy the magnificent views of the area, it’s many activities and cultural discoveries. This is one of our 2 villa in this neighborhood. They're one next to each other. Situated on the Omani cliffs, the villa is fully equipped for your stay with spacious space. There are 4 bedrooms with 3 en-suite bathrooms, the 4th bedroom as access to one of the ensuite bathroom (across the corridor). All the bedrooms are furnished with a super king size bed and comfortable mattresses. Downstairs, you will find a large open space with fully equipped kitchen, dinner area and living room, all giving access onto the terrace with sea view where you can enjoy barbecues and meals outside. You will have full access to the villa to treat as your own, with a shared pool and recreation area (Pool & Ping-Pong tables) of the community. Private and closed garage for 2 car is available as well as outside parking outside. The entire house and garage. If you choose to have the maid services, she will occupy the maid's room downstairs which will be her private corner. We don’t live onsite but we are always a phone call away and we always have someone who is able to meet you for any queries you may have if we’re not available to meet. The villa is located in a very quiet neighborhood and gated community. A small marina is just a few minutes walk away for any boat trip/diving trip or we would be happy to introduce you to our Omani guide for private boat trip where you will be able to see the famous dolphins, sea-turtles and snorkel around the magnificent coast of the area. If you’re adventurous enough, the captain will show you how to catch squid for your dinner. If you’re not feeling like cooking, their is a large choice of restaurants at the walking distance (Shangri-La Hotels). They also offer tennis court, Spa, Gym and beach access with their daily pass (Access pass prices varies on the season and can be quite expensive). *** At the moment, a Marina development is being constructed below the cliff down from the villas. It’s usually not very noisy. The other permanent residents monitor noise levels daily and ensure it remains reasonable. *** A car is strongly recommended if you want to explore and visit as Muscat spread out along the shore over 60km. A EU or UK driving license is valid for up to 3 months provided you use a rental car. We can help you with better rates. Our area is an excellent jump out point for excursion, near highway leading to Sur or up to the mountains and the world class wadis (Canyon) of Oman.""}]","www.airbnb.com",,"[{""value"":[""Pool: This is one of a few places in the area that has this feature."",""Entire home: You’ll have the villa to yourself."",""Great communication: 100% of recent guests rated Harold 5-star in communication.""],""key"":""Highlights""},{""key"":""Average rating"",""value"":[""4.87""],""replace"":""true""},{""value"":[""Hi there!My name is Harold, I’m 30, living between Oman and the UAE.I’m a big passionate of outdoor activities and would be happy to share my tips about Oman and UAE and it’s amazing landscape and climat that offers a wide range of activities to do.

Grazie al contatto che mi ha creato con Khalid, suo amico altrettanto generoso e gentile, che gestisce un ostello per donne, ho potuto fare un trekking in zona e vivere due giornate fuori dalle rotte turistiche in posti bellissimi. Tina è sempre stata generosa e disponibile in ogni momento e mi ha offerto ottime colazioni. La camera è come nelle foto, il letto molto comodo ed il terrazzino ha una bella e ampia vista. Wifi perfetto.

The market towns of Sinaw (30 minutes), Ibra (45 minutes) and Nizwa/Izki/Manah/Adam (60 minutes) are an easy day trip away.The Oasis has phone reception and 4G signal. We are happy to provide a local sim card for the duration of your visit.Regrettably, we cannot accommodate extra guests. Depending on our schedule, we may be able to cater for a later check-in time than the one listed. Let us know when booking if you think you might need this. Contact us if you wish to book more than six months ahead.Guests are free to explore the Oasis keeping to the main paths and pick fruit, herbs and vegetables when in season. Play table tennis in our outdoor games room or sit and read a book or play a board game in the comfort of our large reception majlis/common room. Please note that the outdoor BBQ kitchen, pool, games room and reception majlis are open to all guests. Depending on whether other cabins are booked you may be sharing these spaces with us and upto 6 other travellers.After a day exploring the nearby towns and villages of the historic Ash Sharqiyyah region, the camel enclosures outside the gate, or nearby Wadi Daqeeq, cool off with a relaxing swim in our infinity swimming pool of fresh water drawn from an artesian well (set timings). Please note as this is a desert farm you may encounter all manner of small creatures and bugs. We cannot rule out the occasional scorpion or grass snake. For this reason we advise keeping to paths and cleared ground and consider it unsuitable for children.We will usually be on hand at the farm and contactable by phone. If for any reason, we are not immediately available, there will always be someone on hand at the property to assist you. We are happy to give you recommendations during your stay should you so wish but otherwise will leave you to enjoy the peace and tranquillity.House rulesBoth men and women are required to dress modestly in and around the OasisNo shoes in the cabinQuiet time after 10.00pmNo additional guests in the cabinCheck in 1-6pmCheck out 11.00amAdvance booking 6 monthsMinimum stay – 2 nightsContact me for further information or queries.""}]","www.vrbo.com",,"[{""key"":""Minimum Stay"",""value"":[""2 Days""]}]","[{""amountMax"":15.0,""amountMin"":15.0,""currency"":""USD"",""dateSeen"":[""2022-08-18T22:17:45.680Z"",""2022-10-19T08:40:55.883Z"",""2023-03-25T07:04:29.780Z"",""2023-01-15T23:56:30.716Z"",""2022-12-04T10:11:40.124Z"",""2022-02-02T14:31:36.157Z"",""2021-10-20T11:04:09.773Z"",""2022-05-24T15:43:23.989Z""],""type"":""Cleaning Fee""}]",,,"POINT (58.16069565 22.72248052)","https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/6cf1e5a9.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/270-cb20c787.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/58d7b480.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/270-1396f5a4.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/2092e6c8.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/6c144731.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/ee7a2cb4.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/a1cedc28.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/0dbd02f7.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/aab4c53c.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/51b76b19.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/41780f29.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/270-ee87a747.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/5400cd6b.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/72491d19.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/fcea7ca4.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/51fc8b54.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/04713a7c.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/43d9e528.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/9a5872b6.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/5f89b018.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/27fb33d6.c10.jpg,https://media.vrbo.com/lodging/41000000/40200000/40192300/40192279/fbafcc82.c10.jpg",,"vrbo.com-4739642ha","english,french","22.72248052",,,,"Oman getaway: Neem eco-cabin, close desert, mountains, forts and villages","58.16069565",,,"[{""dateSeen"":""2023-03-25T07:04:29.782Z"",""value"":""Hosted by Bibi Mariam""}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Short Term Rental","2023-03-25T07:04:29.770Z","2021-12-25T15:44:18.097Z",,,,,,,,,,1,1,,2,,,,,"[{""dateSeen"":""2023-03-25T07:04:29.784Z"",""name"":""Hosted by Bibi Mariam"",""title"":""Owner""}]",,,,"[{""amountMax"":125.0,""amountMin"":125.0,""currency"":""USD"",""dateSeen"":[""2023-01-15T23:56:30.718Z"",""2022-12-04T10:11:40.126Z"",""2023-03-25T07:04:29.784Z""],""minStay"":""2"",""period"":""avg/night""},{""amountMax"":105.0,""amountMin"":105.0,""currency"":""USD"",""dateSeen"":[""2021-10-20T11:04:09.776Z"",""2022-10-19T08:40:55.887Z"",""2022-05-24T15:43:23.993Z"",""2021-12-25T15:44:18.115Z"",""2022-02-02T14:31:36.159Z"",""2022-08-18T22:17:45.684Z""],""minStay"":""2"",""period"":""avg/night""}]",,"Cabin","Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate, Oman","[{""date"":""2022-12-12T10:41:22Z"",""dateSeen"":""2023-03-25T07:04:29.784Z"",""rating"":5.0,""text"":""Relaxed oasis.
